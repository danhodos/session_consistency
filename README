SessionConsistency
==================

Ensures session consistency by checking the user_agent and/or remote_ip before each request. If either of these have changed between requests, the filter chain is halted and a '0' HTTP status code is returned.

Base usage:

  class ApplicationController
    verify_session_consistency
  end

You can also specify :except and :only options, just like with a before filter:

  class ApplicationController
    verify_session_consistency :only => :index
  end
  
Perhaps most usefully, you can specify a :redirect option, which takes the same parameters as redirect_to, like so:

  class ApplicationController
    verify_session_consistency :redirect => { :action => 'logout' }
  end
  
Finally, you can modify what the consistency check is based on (by default it is both user_agent and remote_ip) like so:

  class ApplicationController
    verify_session_consistency :based_on => :user_agent
  end
